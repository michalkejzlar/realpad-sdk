# realPad SDK
A simple script to fetch all data from the realPad Takeout API.

## Usage
Clone, replace `LOGIN` and `PASSWORD` in `takeout-download.sh` with credentials you get from us, and run. The script will download the Excel files and store them in the working directory, with unique (timestamped) names.
